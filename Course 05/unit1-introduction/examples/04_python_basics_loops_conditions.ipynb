        "  - Example: Calculate average of 1000 numbers (without loops, you'd write 1000 lines!)\n",
        "  - In data science: Process every row, apply transformations to all data\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Q: When do I use if/else?**\n",
        "  - Answer: Use conditions to make decisions based on data values\n",
