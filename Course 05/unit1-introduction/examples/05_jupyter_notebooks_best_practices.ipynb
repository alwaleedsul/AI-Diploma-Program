    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Write and execute code in Jupyter Notebooks effectively\n",
    "- Combine markdown explanations with code cells\n",
    "- Follow best practices for notebook organization\n",
    "- Ensure reproducibility in your work\n",
    "- Create professional, shareable notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Basic Python knowledge (from Example 4)\n",
    "- ✅ Understanding of code execution\n",
    "- ✅ Jupyter Notebooks installed and running\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Official Structure Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers practical activities from **Course 05, Unit 1**:\n",
    "- Using Jupyter Notebooks: Writing and executing code in Jupyter Notebooks, combining explanation and code to ensure reproducibility\n",
    "- **Source:** `DETAILED_UNIT_DESCRIPTIONS.md` - Unit 1 Practical Content\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites (What You Need First) | المتطلبات الأساسية\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE starting this notebook**, you should have completed:\n",
    "- ✅ **Example 4: Python Basics** - You need to know how to write Python code first!\n",
    "- ✅ **Jupyter Notebooks installed** - You need the tool to use it\n",
    "- ✅ **Basic understanding**: What is a notebook? What are cells?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you haven't completed these**, you might struggle with:\n",
    "- Understanding how to write code in cells\n",
    "- Knowing when to use markdown vs code cells\n",
    "- Understanding notebook execution order\n",
    "- Creating reproducible notebooks\n",

    "## 🔗 Where This Notebook Fits | مكان هذا الدفتر\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the FIFTH example** - it teaches you how to use your tools properly!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this example FIFTH?**\n",
    "- **Before** you can write good notebooks, you need to know Python (Example 4)\n",
    "- **Before** you can organize your work, you need to understand code structure\n",
    "- **After** learning this, all your future notebooks will be professional and reproducible\n",
    "\n",
    "**Builds on**: \n",
    "- 📓 Example 4: Python Basics (you need to know code to write it in notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leads to**: \n",
    "- 📓 Example 6: Data Structures (will use notebook best practices)\n",
    "- 📓 All future notebooks (all should follow these practices!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this order?**\n",
    "1. Notebook practices teach you **how to organize your work** (needed for all projects)\n",
    "2. Best practices ensure **reproducibility** (others can run your code)\n",
    "3. Professional notebooks make you **more effective** (easier to review and share)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Story: Keeping a Lab Notebook | القصة: الاحتفاظ بدفتر المختبر\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a scientist keeping a lab notebook. **Before** you start experiments, you learn how to document properly - date entries, explain methods, record results clearly. **After** learning proper documentation, your work is reproducible and others can understand it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with Jupyter Notebooks: **Before** doing data science, we learn best practices - organize cells, explain code, ensure reproducibility. **After** learning these practices, our notebooks are professional and shareable!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Jupyter Notebook Best Practices Matter | لماذا يهم أفضل الممارسات\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices are essential because:\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Others (and future you) can run your code\n",
    "- **Organization**: Clear structure makes notebooks easy to follow\n",
    "- **Professionalism**: Well-organized notebooks impress employers/clients\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Good practices save time and prevent errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: Why use markdown cells?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Markdown explains WHAT and WHY, code shows HOW\n",
    "  - Example: Markdown explains \"We're calculating average\", code shows the calculation\n",
    "  - Benefit: Makes notebooks readable and educational\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Q: Why set random seeds?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Ensures results are reproducible (same random numbers each run)\n",
    "  - Example: `np.random.seed(42)` before generating random data\n",
    "  - Benefit: Others get the same results when running your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebooks** provide an interactive environment for combining code, documentation, and visualizations. Following best practices ensures your notebooks are professional, reproducible, and easy to understand."
