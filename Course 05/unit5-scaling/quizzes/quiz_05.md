2. Create a Dask DataFrame from a CSV
3. Perform a computation (e.g., groupby)

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

3. Load the model back

```python
import joblib
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Assuming model is trained
model = LogisticRegression()
# ... train model ...

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')

# Load model
loaded_model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
predictions = loaded_model.predict(X_new)
```

## Part 3: Short Answer (10 points)

### Question 8 (5 points)
Explain the key considerations for deploying ML models in production.

**Key Considerations:**
1. **Model Versioning**: Track different model versions
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor model performance and data drift
3. **Scalability**: Handle varying loads (horizontal scaling)
4. **Latency**: Ensure fast prediction times
5. **Reliability**: Error handling and fallback mechanisms
6. **Security**: Protect models and data
7. **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results
8. **Documentation**: Clear API documentation
9. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before deployment
10. **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

### Question 9 (5 points)
What are the main challenges when scaling data science workflows? How can they be addressed?

**Main Challenges:**
1. **Memory Limitations**: Large datasets don't fit in memory
   - Solution: Use chunking, Dask, or distributed systems
   
2. **Computation Time**: Processing takes too long
   - Solution: Parallel processing, GPU acceleration, distributed computing
   
3. **Data Distribution**: Data stored across multiple locations
   - Solution: Distributed file systems (HDFS, S3), data partitioning
   
4. **Model Complexity**: Complex models are slow to train/predict
   - Solution: Model optimization, quantization, hardware acceleration
   
5. **Real-time Requirements**: Need fast predictions
   - Solution: Model optimization, caching, dedicated inference servers

**Tools:**
- Dask for distributed computing
- RAPIDS for GPU acceleration
- Spark for big data processing
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
