## Part 2: Short Answer Questions (30 points)

### Question 7 (10 points)
**CLO1:** Explain the difference between traditional AI (rule-based) and modern AI (data-driven). Provide a real-world example of each.

---

### Question 8 (10 points)
**CLO2:** Describe how the A* search algorithm works. What makes it more efficient than BFS or DFS?

---

### Question 9 (10 points)
**CLO3:** Explain knowledge representation and provide two methods used to represent knowledge in AI systems.

---

## Part 3: Practical/Coding Questions (25 points)

### Question 10 (15 points)
**CLO2:** Implement a simple BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm in Python to find a path in a graph. Use the following graph structure:

```python
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
```

Find the path from 'A' to 'F'.

### Question 11 (10 points)
**CLO6:** Write Python code to create a simple feedforward neural network with:
- Input layer: 3 neurons
- Hidden layer: 4 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation

---

## Part 4: Case Study / Real-World Application (15 points)

### Question 12 (15 points)
**CLO5, CLO7:** You are building an AI system for a hospital to help diagnose diseases. The system needs to:
1. Process patient symptoms (supervised learning)
2. Find patterns in patient data (unsupervised learning)
3. Use neural networks for complex pattern recognition

Explain how you would design this system using concepts from this course. Include:
- Which AI approach you'd use for each component
- Why you chose each approach
- How you would evaluate the system
