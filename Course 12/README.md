## Course Overview | نظرة عامة على الدورة

This is the capstone project course where students apply all knowledge gained throughout the AI Diploma Program to solve a real-world problem. Students will design, implement, and deploy a complete AI system.

**Course Code:** AIAT 126  
**Language:** Bilingual (Arabic/English)
**Credit Hours:** 3  
**Lecture Hours:** 1  
**Practical Hours:** 4  
**Total Hours:** 80 (16 theoretical + 64 practical)

**Unit Breakdown:**
- Unit 1: 4 theoretical + 10 practical = 14 hours
- Unit 2: 3 theoretical + 12 practical = 15 hours
- Unit 3: 3 theoretical + 14 practical = 17 hours
- Unit 4: 3 theoretical + 14 practical = 17 hours
- Unit 5: 3 theoretical + 14 practical = 17 hours
