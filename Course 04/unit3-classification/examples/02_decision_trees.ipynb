    "## The Story: Making Decisions Like a Tree | القصة: اتخاذ القرارات مثل الشجرة\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're deciding what to wear. **Before** decision trees, you use a simple rule (like logistic regression). **After** decision trees, you use a series of questions: \"Is it raining? → Yes → Wear raincoat. No → Is it cold? → Yes → Wear jacket...\" - much more flexible!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with machine learning: **Before** decision trees, we use simple linear boundaries. **After** decision trees, we use complex if-then rules that can handle any pattern!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Decision Tree? | ما هي شجرة القرار؟\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Decision Tree is a classification algorithm that makes predictions by asking a series of yes/no questions about the data features.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Decision Trees Work | كيف تعمل أشجار القرار\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start at the Root**: Begin with all data at the top (root node)\n",
    "2. **Ask Questions**: At each step, ask: \"Is feature X > value Y?\"\n",
    "3. **Split Data**: Based on the answer, split data into two groups (left/right)\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Continue asking questions and splitting until you reach a decision\n",
    "5. **Make Prediction**: When you reach a leaf node (no more splits), predict the class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example | مثال بسيط\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting if someone will buy a product:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Start: All customers\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Question 1: Is age > 30?\n",
    "  ├─ YES → Question 2: Is income > $50k?\n",
    "  │         ├─ YES → Predict: Will buy ✅\n",
    "  │         └─ NO → Predict: Won't buy ❌\n",
    "  └─ NO → Predict: Won't buy ❌\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components | المكونات الرئيسية\n",
    "- **Root Node**: Top of the tree (starts with all data)\n",
    "- **Internal Nodes**: Decision points (ask questions)\n",
    "- **Branches**: Paths based on answers (yes/no)\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: Final predictions (no more questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Decision Trees Matter | لماذا تهم أشجار القرار؟\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are powerful and interpretable:\n",
    "- **Interpretable**: You can see exactly how decisions are made (if-then rules)\n",
    "- **Non-Linear**: Can handle complex patterns that linear models can't\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Automatically shows which features matter most\n",
    "- **No Scaling Needed**: Works with raw data (unlike logistic regression)\n",
    "- **Random Forest**: Combines many trees for better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Random Forest? | ما هي الغابة العشوائية؟\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines many decision trees to make better predictions than a single tree.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Random Forest Works | كيف تعمل الغابة العشوائية\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build Many Trees**: Create 100+ decision trees (each trained on different data)\n",
    "2. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Each tree sees a random sample of training data (with replacement)\n",
    "3. **Random Features**: Each tree uses a random subset of features at each split\n",
    "4. **Vote for Prediction**: All trees vote, final prediction = majority vote\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example | مثال بسيط\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting if someone will buy a product:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tree 1 says: Will buy ✅\n",
    "Tree 2 says: Will buy ✅\n",
    "Tree 3 says: Won't buy ❌\n",
    "Tree 4 says: Will buy ✅\n",
    "Tree 5 says: Will buy ✅\n",
    "...\n",
    "Tree 100 says: Will buy ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Prediction: Will buy ✅ (majority vote: 97 trees say YES)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Random Forest is Better | لماذا الغابة العشوائية أفضل\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduces Overfitting**: Single tree can overfit, but averaging many trees reduces this\n",
    "- **More Robust**: Less sensitive to data changes (one tree can't ruin everything)\n",
    "- **Better Performance**: Usually performs better than a single tree\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Shows which features matter across all trees\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**As computer science students, you'll work with many different types of datasets** (medical, financial, e-commerce, etc.). **What matters is the data structure, not the domain knowledge!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure Focus**:\n",
    "- **Data Shape**: 891 rows × 7 features (passenger records × features)\n",
    "- **Feature Types**: Mix of numerical (Age, Fare, Pclass, SibSp, Parch) and categorical (Sex, Embarked - encoded)\n",
    "- **Target Type**: Binary classification (predicting Survived: 0 = High Risk, 1 = Low Risk)\n",
    "- **Task**: Predict passenger security risk level based on passenger characteristics\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Real-world historical data with binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Structure Matters**:\n",
    "- **Binary classification** → Need classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix)\n",
    "- **Mixed feature types** → Decision trees work well (can handle both numerical and categorical)\n",
    "- **Medium dataset** → Good for learning, but need to be careful about overfitting\n",
    "- **Real-world data** → Shows decision trees on real security screening problem\n",

    "- **Real data**: Historical passenger records with realistic features and patterns\n",
    "\n",

    "**Domain Context** (Brief):\n",
    "- **Features**: Passenger characteristics (Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch, Embarked)\n",
    "- **Target**: Security Risk (Survived=1 = Low Risk, Survived=0 = High Risk)\n",
    "- **Task**: Predict passenger risk level from passenger characteristics\n",
    "- **GDI Context**: Airport Security - passenger risk assessment for security screening\n",
    "- **Why trees work**: Different passenger profiles have different risk patterns → trees can learn these patterns\n",

    "- Understanding the **data structure** (rows, columns, types, classes)\n",
    "- Knowing the **task type** (binary classification: 2 classes)\n",
    "- Understanding how **decision trees** can learn patterns from features\n",

    "**Q: What's the difference between Decision Tree and Random Forest?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Decision Tree**: Single tree (interpretable, can overfit easily)\n",
    "  - **Random Forest**: Many trees combined (less overfitting, better performance, less interpretable)\n",
    "  - **Key difference**: Random Forest = ensemble of many decision trees\n",
    "  - **Use Decision Tree**: When you need interpretability (see the rules)\n",
    "  - **Use Random Forest**: When you need better performance (more accurate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do Decision Trees overfit so easily?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Trees can grow very deep (many splits):\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Deep trees memorize training data → perfect training accuracy, poor test accuracy\n",
    "  - **Sign**: Training accuracy = 100%, Test accuracy = 70% → overfitting!\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Limit tree depth (max_depth), or use Random Forest\n",
    "  - **Rule of thumb**: Start with max_depth=5, increase if needed, stop when test performance drops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I choose max_depth?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Try different values and compare train vs test performance:\n",
    "  - **Too low (max_depth=2)**: Underfitting (both train and test accuracy low)\n",
    "  - **Too high (max_depth=20)**: Overfitting (train accuracy high, test accuracy low)\n",
    "  - **Good (max_depth=5-10)**: Balanced (both train and test accuracy good, similar)\n",
    "  - **Method**: Try 3, 5, 10, 15, pick the one with best test performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Do Decision Trees need feature scaling?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **NO!** Unlike logistic regression, trees don't need scaling:\n",
    "  - **Why**: Trees split on feature values, not distances\n",
    "  - **Example**: Split on \"age > 30\" works the same whether age is 0-100 or 0-1\n",
    "  - **Advantage**: One less preprocessing step needed!\n",
    "  - **Note**: Random Forest also doesn't need scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is feature importance?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Shows which features the tree uses most for decisions:\n",
    "  - **High importance**: Feature used in many splits, near top of tree\n",
    "  - **Low importance**: Feature rarely used, near bottom of tree\n",
    "  - **Interpretation**: Features with high importance matter more for predictions\n",
    "  - **Use**: Understand which features your model relies on most\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When should I use Decision Trees vs Logistic Regression?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Use Decision Trees**: Non-linear patterns, need interpretability, no scaling needed\n",
    "  - **Use Logistic Regression**: Linear patterns, need fast predictions, features are scaled\n",
    "  - **Try both**: Compare performance, pick the one that works better\n",
    "  - **Rule**: If data has complex patterns → Decision Trees, if simple patterns → Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between Decision Tree and Random Forest accuracy?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Random Forest usually performs better:\n",
    "  - **Decision Tree**: Single tree, can overfit, accuracy depends on one tree\n",
    "  - **Random Forest**: Many trees averaged, less overfitting, more stable accuracy\n",
    "  - **Example**: Decision Tree = 85% accuracy, Random Forest = 92% accuracy\n",

    "- **Answer**: **Not directly** - sklearn Decision Trees need complete data:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Missing values break tree splits\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Impute missing values first (mean, median, mode) or remove rows\n",

    "**Symptoms You'll See:**\n",
    "- Training accuracy is very high (95-100%) but test accuracy is much lower (75-85%)\n",
    "- Large gap between train and test accuracy (overfitting)\n",
    "- Even with pruning, test accuracy doesn't improve much\n",
    "- Need for more robust boundaries that generalize better\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis - Check These Indicators:**\n",
    "1. Compare train vs test accuracy - large gap?\n",
    "2. Try different max_depth values - does test accuracy improve?\n",
    "3. Try Random Forest - does it help significantly?\n",
    "4. If still need better generalization → try SVM (optimal margin)\n",

    "**Summary of What We Learned:**\n",
    "- ✅ Decision Trees solved the non-linear problem Logistic Regression failed on\n",
    "- ✅ Decision Trees work well on complex, non-linear data with interpretable rules\n",
    "- ✅ Random Forest reduces overfitting by combining multiple trees\n",
    "- ❌ **But**: Decision Trees can overfit (train 98% vs test 77% - large gap!)\n",
    "- ❌ **But**: Decision Trees don't always create optimal margin boundaries\n",

    "**The Key Problem We Identified:**\n",
    "- We need **optimal margin boundaries** for better generalization on unseen data\n",
    "- Decision Trees create boundaries based on training data locations, not optimal margins\n",
    "- We need an algorithm that finds the **maximum margin** (widest gap) between classes\n",
