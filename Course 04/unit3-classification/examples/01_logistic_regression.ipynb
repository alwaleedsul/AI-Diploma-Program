    "\n",
    "1. **`.predict_proba()`** - Returns probabilities for each class\n",
    "   - **Input**: Features (X)\n",
    "   - **Output**: Array of probabilities [P(Class 0), P(Class 1)]\n",
    "   - **Example**: `[0.2, 0.8]` means 20% chance Class 0, 80% chance Class 1\n",
    "   - **Why**: Shows model's confidence, not just the prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`.decision_function()`** - Returns the linear combination (z) before sigmoid\n",
    "   - **Input**: Features (X)\n",
    "   - **Output**: Raw score (z) - can be any real number\n",
    "   - **Example**: z = 2.5 → sigmoid(2.5) ≈ 0.92 → high probability of Class 1\n",
    "   - **Why**: Shows the \"raw\" linear combination before it's converted to probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the visualization:**\n",
    "- We'll use `.decision_function()` to get z values (x-axis)\n",
    "- We'll use `.predict_proba()` to get probabilities (y-axis)\n",
    "- This shows how z (linear) maps to probability (sigmoid)\n"

    "\n",
    "**BEFORE**: We've been using the default threshold of 0.5 (if probability > 0.5, predict class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER**: We'll explore how different thresholds affect precision and recall - this is crucial for real-world applications!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: \n",
    "- **Default threshold (0.5)**: May not be optimal for your problem\n",
    "- **Lower threshold (e.g., 0.3)**: More aggressive → Higher recall, lower precision\n",
    "- **Higher threshold (e.g., 0.7)**: More conservative → Higher precision, lower recall\n",
    "- **Real-world**: Fraud detection might need high recall (catch all fraud cases), spam detection might need high precision (don't block real emails)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: Why not always use 0.5?**\n",
    "  - Answer: 0.5 assumes equal cost of false positives and false negatives\n",
    "  - Real-world: Missing fraud (FN) is worse than false alarm (FP) in fraud detection\n",
    "  - Solution: Lower threshold for high recall, higher threshold for high precision\n",
    "- **Q: How do I choose the right threshold?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Depends on your problem's cost of errors\n",
    "  - High recall needed: Fraud detection, threat detection (catch all cases)\n",
    "  - High precision needed: Spam detection, content moderation (few false positives)\n",
    "  - Balanced: Use F1 score to find optimal threshold\n",

    "### ❓ Common Student Questions | الأسئلة الشائعة للطلاب\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1: Why can't we just use polynomial features with Logistic Regression?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: You CAN use polynomial features, but they have limitations:\n",
    "  - Polynomial features create MANY new features (combinatorial explosion)\n",
    "  - Example: 10 features → 100+ polynomial features → slow and overfitting risk\n",
    "  - Decision Trees handle non-linearity naturally without creating many features\n",
    "  - **When to use polynomial features**: Slightly non-linear data, few features (< 5)\n",
    "  - **When to use Decision Trees**: Highly non-linear data, many features, complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: What if my data is only slightly non-linear?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Try these in order:\n",
    "  1. **First**: Try Logistic Regression with polynomial features (degree=2 or 3)\n",
    "  2. **If that doesn't help**: Use Decision Trees (they handle any level of non-linearity)\n",
    "  3. **If you need interpretability**: Decision Trees are more interpretable than polynomial features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: Why Decision Trees next, and not SVM or Random Forest?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Decision Trees are the **simplest** non-linear classifier:\n",
    "  - **Decision Trees**: Easy to understand, interpretable, handles non-linear naturally\n",
    "  - **SVM**: More complex, requires kernel selection, less interpretable\n",
    "  - **Random Forest**: Built on Decision Trees (you need to learn trees first!)\n",
    "  - **Learning order**: Start simple (Decision Trees) → then advanced (SVM, Random Forest)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: How do I know BEFORE training if my data is non-linear?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Check these BEFORE training:\n",
    "  1. **Visualize**: Plot features in 2D/3D - do you see curves/circles?\n",
    "  2. **Domain knowledge**: Does your problem naturally have non-linear relationships?\n",
    "  3. **Correlation**: Check if features have non-linear correlations (scatter plots)\n",
    "  4. **Try both**: Train Logistic Regression first - if accuracy is poor, likely non-linear\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: What if I have many features and can't visualize?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Use these techniques:\n",
    "  1. **PCA**: Reduce to 2-3 dimensions, then visualize\n",
    "  2. **Pair plots**: Plot pairs of important features\n",
    "  3. **Train and check**: If Logistic Regression accuracy is poor → likely non-linear\n",
    "  4. **Feature importance**: Use Decision Trees to see which features matter (works for any data)\n",
