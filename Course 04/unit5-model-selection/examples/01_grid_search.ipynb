    "## 📚 Prerequisites (What You Need First) | المتطلبات الأساسية\n",

    "**BEFORE starting this notebook**, you should have completed:\n",
    "- ✅ **Unit 1-4: All examples** - Data processing, regression, classification, clustering\n",
    "- ✅ **Unit 2, Example 2: Cross-Validation** - Understanding CV for model evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ **Understanding of hyperparameters**: Parameters that control model behavior (not learned from data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you haven't completed these**, you might struggle with:\n",
    "- Understanding why hyperparameter tuning is needed\n",
    "- Knowing when to use Grid Search vs Random Search\n",

    "**This is Unit 5, Example 1** - it's about finding the best hyperparameters automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this example FIRST in Unit 5?**\n",
    "- **Before** you can use advanced techniques, you need to tune hyperparameters properly\n",
    "- **Before** you can compare models, you need each model at its best (tuned hyperparameters)\n",
    "- **Before** you can use boosting, you need to understand hyperparameter tuning\n",

    "Imagine you're tuning a radio. **Before** Grid Search, you try settings randomly (might miss the best one). **After** Grid Search, you try all combinations systematically - guaranteed to find the best settings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with machine learning: **Before** Grid Search, we guess hyperparameters (might not be optimal). **After** Grid Search, we try all combinations and pick the best - much better performance!\n",

    "**BEFORE**: We've been using default hyperparameters or guessing values manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER**: We'll use Grid Search and Random Search to automatically find the best hyperparameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: Hyperparameters dramatically affect model performance. Automatic tuning finds optimal values much better than manual guessing!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: Why not just use default hyperparameters?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Defaults are generic (work for average cases), but your data might need different values\n",
    "  - Example: Default C=1.0 for SVM might not be optimal → Grid Search finds best C for your data\n",
    "  - Tuning hyperparameters can improve accuracy by 5-20% (significant improvement!)\n",
    "- **Q: What's the difference between parameters and hyperparameters?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Parameters = learned from data (e.g., coefficients in linear regression)\n",
    "  - Hyperparameters = set before training (e.g., C, gamma, max_depth, learning_rate)\n",
    "  - Parameters are learned, hyperparameters are tuned!\n",
    "- **Q: Why use Grid Search instead of trying values manually?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Grid Search tries ALL combinations systematically → guaranteed to find best (within grid)\n",
    "  - Manual = might miss optimal values, slow, error-prone\n",
    "  - Grid Search = systematic, automatic, finds best combination\n",
    "- **Q: Why is Grid Search slow?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Grid Search tries ALL combinations → if you have 3 hyperparameters with 5 values each = 5×5×5 = 125 combinations\n",
    "  - Each combination needs cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold CV) → 125 × 5 = 625 model trainings!\n",
    "  - Solution: Use smaller grids or Random Search (tries random combinations, faster)\n",
    "- **Q: When should I use Grid Search vs Random Search?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Grid Search = thorough but slow (use when you have few hyperparameters or small grids)\n",
    "  - Random Search = faster, often finds good solutions (use when you have many hyperparameters or large grids)\n",
    "  - Rule of thumb: Start with Random Search, use Grid Search to fine-tune around best Random Search result\n"
