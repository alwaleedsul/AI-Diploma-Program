    "### Why Split Data into Train and Test? | لماذا نقسم البيانات إلى تدريب واختبار؟\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE**: We have all our data (features X and target y), but we can't use all of it for training!\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER**: We'll split data into training set (80%) and test set (20%) to properly evaluate our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why split data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: If we train AND test on the same data, the model will \"memorize\" the data instead of learning patterns!\n",
    "- **Example**: Like a student who memorizes answers to specific questions\n",
    "- **Result**: Model gets perfect scores on training data, but fails on new data\n",
    "- **This is called \"Overfitting\"** - model memorizes instead of learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: Split data into TWO separate sets:\n",
    "1. **Training Set (X_train, y_train)** - 80% of data\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Model LEARNS from this data\n",
    "   - **What happens**: Model sees features (X_train) and correct answers (y_train)\n",
    "   - **Process**: Model finds the best line that fits this data\n",
    "   - **Like**: Student studying from a textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Set (X_test, y_test)** - 20% of data\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Model is EVALUATED on this data\n",
    "   - **What happens**: Model sees features (X_test) but NOT answers (y_test)\n",
    "   - **Process**: Model makes predictions, we compare with actual answers\n",
    "   - **Like**: Student taking an exam (unseen questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- Model learns patterns from training data (not memorizing)\n",
    "- Test data is \"unseen\" - model hasn't seen it during training\n",
    "- If model performs well on test data → model learned general patterns!\n",
    "- If model performs poorly on test data → model overfitted (memorized training data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test?**\n",
    "- **X_train**: Training features (inputs) - what model learns from\n",
    "- **y_train**: Training targets (outputs) - correct answers for training\n",
    "- **X_test**: Test features (inputs) - what model predicts on\n",
    "- **y_test**: Test targets (outputs) - correct answers for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why 80/20 split?**\n",
    "- Good balance - need enough training data (80%) to learn, enough test data (20%) to evaluate\n",
    "- Can adjust: Small datasets (<1000) → 70/30, Large datasets (>10k) → 90/10\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can I use test data for training?**\n",
    "- NO! Never use test data for training - this defeats the purpose!\n",
    "- Problem: If model sees test data during training, it's not a fair test\n",
    "- Rule: Test data should be \"locked away\" until final evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if I need more training data?**\n",
    "- Use cross-validation (Unit 2) - splits data multiple ways without wasting test set\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why split X and y separately?**\n",
    "- X (features) and y (target) must stay together!\n",
    "- Each row in X_train corresponds to same row in y_train\n",
    "- train_test_split keeps them aligned automatically"

    "  - `size` (MedInc): Median income affects house value (higher income areas = more expensive)\n",
    "  - `age` (HouseAge): House age affects value (newer houses = more expensive)\n",
    "  - `rooms` (AveRooms): Average rooms affects value (more rooms = more expensive)\n",
    "  - `population`: Population affects value (densely populated areas may differ)\n",
    "  - We use **MULTIPLE features** because house value depends on **MANY factors**!\n",

    "- **y (Target) = Single output** we want to predict:\n",
    "  - `price` (MedHouseVal): The **ONE thing** we're trying to predict (median house value)\n",
    "  - We predict **ONE value** (house value) from **MULTIPLE inputs** (features)\n",
    "  - This is the standard ML pattern: **Multiple inputs → Single output**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "MedHouseVal = intercept + (coef1 × MedInc) + (coef2 × HouseAge)\n",
    " + (coef3 × AveRooms) + (coef4 × Population)\n",

    "1. **Build SEPARATE models** (one for each target) - **Recommended for beginners**\n",

    "   - **Why?** Each target might depend on features differently\n",
    "   - **Example**: Price might depend more on size, days_on_market might depend more on location\n",
    "   - This is called \"Multi-Output Regression\" (separate models)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Multi-Output Regression** (one model, multiple outputs)\n",
    "   - `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()` can handle multiple targets\n",
    "   - `y = [[price1, days1], [price2, days2], ...]` (2D array with multiple columns)\n",
    "   - Model learns separate coefficients for each target\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     price = b₀₁ + b₁₁×size + b₂₁×bedrooms + ...\n",
    "     days  = b₀₂ + b₁₂×size + b₂₂×bedrooms + ...\n",

    "Great job completing this example!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression - Your First ML Model:**\n",
    "- **Simple Linear Regression**: Predicts a continuous target using one feature. Finds the best line (y = mx + b) that minimizes prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extends to multiple features. Predicts target using multiple inputs simultaneously. Formula: y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared difference between predictions and actual values (lower is better)\n",
    "  - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference (more interpretable than MSE)\n",
    "  - **R² (R-squared)**: Proportion of variance explained (0 to 1, higher is better, 1 = perfect fit)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Residual Analysis**: Residuals (errors) should be randomly distributed around zero. Patterns in residuals indicate model problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Coefficients show how much each feature affects the prediction. Larger absolute coefficients = more important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 How This Connects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**This example builds on and leads to:**\n",
    "- **Example 1-3**: Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing prepare data for ML models\n",
    "- **Example 5: Polynomial Regression** - Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships\n",
    "- **Unit 2: Advanced Regression** - Ridge and Lasso regression improve on basic linear regression\n",
    "- **Unit 3: Classification** - Similar workflow (fit, predict, evaluate) but for categorical targets\n",
    "- **All ML Models**: Linear regression teaches the fundamental ML workflow used by all models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this example is important:**\n",
    "1. **First ML model**: Simplest model, easiest to understand\n",
    "2. **ML workflow**: Teaches the standard process: prepare data → train model → evaluate → interpret\n",
    "3. **Foundation**: Many advanced models build on linear regression concepts\n",
    "4. **Interpretability**: Linear models are highly interpretable - you can see exactly how features affect predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. **Linear regression finds the best line**: Minimizes prediction error using least squares method\n",
    "2. **Multiple features improve predictions**: More relevant features generally lead to better models\n",
    "3. **Evaluation metrics matter**: MSE, MAE, and R² tell you how good your model is\n",
    "4. **Residuals reveal problems**: Check residuals to diagnose model issues\n",
    "5. **Coefficients show feature importance**: Understand which features matter most\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Complete exercises in `exercises/` folder to practice building linear regression models\n",
    "- Review quiz materials to test your understanding\n",
    "- Proceed to **Example 5: Polynomial Regression** to handle non-linear relationships\n",
    "- Then move to **Unit 2: Advanced Regression** for Ridge and Lasso techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Tips for Success:**\n",
    "- **Data quality matters**: Clean, preprocessed data leads to better models\n",
    "- **Feature selection**: Not all features help - remove irrelevant ones\n",
    "- **Check assumptions**: Linear regression assumes linear relationships - verify this!\n",
    "- **Visualize**: Always plot your data and residuals to understand what's happening"
