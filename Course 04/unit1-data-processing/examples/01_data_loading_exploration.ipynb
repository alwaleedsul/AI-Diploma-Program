    "- **Data Shape**: 50 rows (US states) × 5 columns\n",
    "- **Feature Types**: Mixed types - 4 numerical (Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, Rape) and 1 categorical (State)\n",
    "- **Target Type**: Exploratory analysis (understanding patterns in crime/security data by state)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do we need to explore data before building models?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: You can't build good models on bad data! Exploration helps you:\n",
    "  - Find problems early (missing values, duplicates, outliers)\n",
    "  - Understand data structure (what columns mean, what types you have)\n",
    "  - Make informed decisions (what preprocessing is needed)\n",
    "  - Save time later (catch issues before they break your models)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between .head() and .tail()?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - `.head(n)`: Shows first n rows (default: 5)\n",
    "  - `.tail(n)`: Shows last n rows (default: 5)\n",
    "  - **Why both?** Check beginning AND end to see if data is consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why check for missing values? Can't I just ignore them?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **NO!** ML models can't work with missing data. You MUST handle them:\n",
    "  - **Option 1**: Remove rows with missing values (if few missing)\n",
    "  - **Option 2**: Fill missing values (mean, median, mode, or prediction)\n",
    "  - **Option 3**: Use algorithms that handle missing values (advanced)\n",
    "  - **We'll learn this in Example 2: Data Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between mean and median?**\n",
    "- **Answer**:\n",
    "  - **Mean**: Average (sum of all values / count) - affected by outliers\n",
    "  - **Median**: Middle value (50th percentile) - NOT affected by outliers\n",
    "  - **Example**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 100] → Mean = 22, Median = 3\n",
    "  - **When to use**: Use median when you have outliers (extreme values)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why check for duplicates?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Duplicates can bias your models:\n",
    "  - Same data counted twice → model learns from same pattern twice\n",
    "  - Wastes computational resources\n",
    "  - Indicates data collection issues\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Remove duplicates (we'll learn in Example 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if my dataset has different structure (different columns, types)?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **That's normal!** Every dataset is different. The key is:\n",
    "  - **Understand YOUR data structure** (rows, columns, types)\n",
    "  - **Apply the same exploration steps** (shape, types, missing values, duplicates)\n",
    "  - **Adapt to your specific data** (different columns need different analysis)\n",
