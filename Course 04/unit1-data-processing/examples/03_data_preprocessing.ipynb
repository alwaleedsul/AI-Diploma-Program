        "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
        "- **Q: Why split data into train and test?**\n",
        "  - Answer: Need unseen data to evaluate model performance honestly\n",
        "  - Problem: Testing on training data = model memorized data → gives false high scores\n",
        "  - Solution: Train on 80%, test on 20% → see how model performs on new data\n",
        "  - Real-world: Model must work on data it hasn't seen before!\n",
        "- **Q: Why 80/20 split?**\n",
        "  - Answer: Good balance between training (need enough to learn) and testing (need enough to evaluate)\n",
        "  - 80% training: Enough data for model to learn patterns\n",
        "  - 20% testing: Enough data for reliable performance evaluation\n",
        "  - Can adjust: Small datasets (<1000) → 70/30, Large datasets (>10k) → 90/10\n",
        "- **Q: What is random_state?**\n",
        "  - Answer: Seed for random number generator → ensures same split every time\n",
        "  - Problem: Without seed, different split each run → can't reproduce results\n",
        "  - Solution: Set random_state=57 → same split every time (reproducibility)\n",
        "  - Note: We use 57 here (not 42) - different projects use different seeds for variety\n",
        "  - Important: Use same random_state within one project to compare fairly\n",
        "- **Q: What is stratify=y?**\n",
        "  - Answer: Maintains class distribution in train/test sets\n",
        "  - Problem: Random split might create imbalanced train/test (e.g., 60% class 0 in train, 40% in test)\n",
        "  - Solution: stratify=y → train and test have same class distribution\n",
        "  - Example: If 60% class 0, 40% class 1 → both train and test have 60/40 split\n",
        "  - Use when: Classification problems with imbalanced classes\n",
        "- **Q: Should I split before or after preprocessing?**\n",
        "  - Answer: Split FIRST, then preprocess train and test separately!\n",
        "  - Why: Fit scaler/encoder on training data only, then transform both train and test\n",
        "  - Problem: Preprocessing before split = data leakage (test data influences training)\n",
        "  - Correct order: Split → Fit on train → Transform train and test\n",
        "  - Note: In this notebook, we show preprocessing on full data for simplicity, but in real projects, split first!"
