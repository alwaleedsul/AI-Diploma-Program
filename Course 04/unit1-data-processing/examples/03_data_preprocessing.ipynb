    "\n",
    "**BEFORE**: We have nominal categories (no order, like city names), but ML algorithms need numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER**: We'll encode categories using One-Hot Encoding - creates separate binary columns for each category!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: What is One-Hot Encoding?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Each category becomes a separate binary column (0 or 1)\n",
    "  - Example: City ['Riyadh', 'Jeddah', 'Dammam'] → 3 columns: city_Riyadh, city_Jeddah, city_Dammam\n",
    "  - Each row has 1 in one column (the city), 0 in all others\n",
    "  - No false order → perfect for nominal categories\n",
    "- **Q: Why use One-Hot instead of Label Encoding?**\n",
    "  - Answer: One-Hot treats all categories equally (no false order)\n",
    "  - Label encoding creates false order for nominal data (e.g., 'Red'=0, 'Blue'=1 → algorithm thinks Blue > Red)\n",
    "  - One-Hot: Each category is independent → no order assumptions\n",
    "  - Use One-Hot for: City names, colors, departments, any categories without order\n",
    "- **Q: Why does One-Hot create so many columns?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Each category needs its own column to represent it independently\n",
    "  - Example: 10 cities → 10 columns (or 9 if using drop='first')\n",
    "  - Trade-off: More columns = more memory, but no false order\n",
    "  - Solution: For many categories (>50), consider Target Encoding or Frequency Encoding\n",
    "- **Q: What is drop='first' in sklearn OneHotEncoder?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Drops the first category column to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "  - Problem: If you have N categories, you only need N-1 columns (one is redundant)\n",
    "  - Example: 4 cities → 3 columns (can infer 4th from the other 3)\n",
    "  - Why: Prevents perfect correlation between columns (helps with linear models)\n",
    "- **Q: When should I use pandas get_dummies vs sklearn OneHotEncoder?**\n",
    "  - Answer: pandas get_dummies = easier, good for quick work\n",
    "  - sklearn OneHotEncoder = more control (drop='first', sparse matrices, better for pipelines)\n",

    "- **Q: Why 80/20 split?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Good balance between training (need enough to learn) and testing (need enough to evaluate)\n",

    "1. **Standardization for normal data** - Use when data is normally distributed\n",
    "2. **Normalization for bounded values** - Use when you need [0,1] range\n",
    "3. **Label encoding for ordinal** - Use when categories have inherent order\n",
    "4. **One-hot for nominal** - Use when categories have no order\n",
    "5. **80/20 is standard** - Use for most datasets (adjust for very small/large)\n",
    "6. **Always scale before encoding** - Scale numeric features first, then encode categorical\n",
    "7. **Test your choices** - Try different methods and compare results\n",
