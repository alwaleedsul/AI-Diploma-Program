    "  - Label encoding preserves order → use for ordinal\n",

    "  - Example: Small=0, Medium=1, Large=2 → algorithm knows Large > Medium > Small\n",

    "  - Solution: Use One-Hot Encoding for nominal categories (no false order)\n",

    "  - Use One-Hot for: City names, colors, departments, any categories without order\n",
    "- **Q: Why does One-Hot create so many columns?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Each category needs its own column to represent it independently\n",
    "  - Example: 10 cities → 10 columns (or 9 if using drop='first')\n",
    "  - Trade-off: More columns = more memory, but no false order\n",
