## Part 1: Classification Algorithms (20 points)

### Question 1 (5 points)
**Answer: A**
- Regression predicts continuous values, classification predicts categories

### Question 2 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- Logistic Regression uses sigmoid function

### Question 3 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize

### Question 4 (5 points)
**Answer: A**
- SVM finds the best decision boundary that maximizes the margin

## Part 2: Evaluation Metrics (20 points)

### Question 5 (5 points)
**Answer: A**
- Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances

### Question 6 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- Precision is the proportion of positive predictions that are correct

### Question 7 (5 points)
**Answer: C**
- Recall is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified

### Question 8 (5 points)
**Answer: D**
- F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Part 3: Confusion Matrix and ROC (20 points)

### Question 9 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- True Positive (TP) represents correctly predicted positive cases

### Question 10 (5 points)
**Answer: A**
- False Positive (FP) is when model predicted Class 1, but actual is Class 0 (false alarm)

### Question 11 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- False Negative (FN) is when model predicted Class 0, but actual is Class 1 (missed detection)

### Question 12 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes

---

## Part 4: Logistic Regression Details (10 points)

### Question 13 (5 points)
**Answer: C**
- Metrics are calculated after training, on test data

### Question 14 (5 points)
**Answer: B**
- `.predict()` returns classes (0 or 1), `.predict_proba()` returns probabilities (0-1)

## Common Student Mistakes | الأخطاء الشائعة للطلاب

1. **Confusing precision and recall**: Students often mix up which one measures what
2. **TP/FP/TN/FN confusion**: Students struggle with the True/False and Positive/Negative combinations
3. **When metrics are calculated**: Some students think metrics are calculated before training
4. **`.predict()` vs `.predict_proba()`**: Students confuse which returns what
