## 🎓 Impact for Students

### Before These Changes
- ❌ Students knew HOW to use methods
- ❌ Students didn't know WHEN to use methods
- ❌ Missing decision-making guidance
- ❌ No comparison between methods

### After These Changes
- ✅ Students know HOW to use methods (technical implementation)
- ✅ Students know WHEN to use methods (decision frameworks)
- ✅ Students can compare methods (comparison tables)

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Review Changes (Optional)
- Review a sample notebook to see the new decision frameworks
- Check that the frameworks make sense for your teaching style

### 2. Push to Students
```bash
# Commit changes
git add "Course 04/"
git commit -m "Add decision frameworks to all Course 04 notebooks - 100% objective coverage"

# Push to students
git push origin main  # or your branch name
```

### 3. Announce to Students
- Let students know about the new decision frameworks
- Explain that they now have guidance on WHEN to use each method
- Encourage them to use the decision trees and practice exercises
