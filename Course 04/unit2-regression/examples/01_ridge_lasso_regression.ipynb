    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites (What You Need First) | المتطلبات الأساسية\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE starting this notebook**, you should have completed:\n",
    "- ✅ **Unit 1: All examples** - Data processing, linear regression, polynomial regression\n",
    "- ✅ **Understanding of overfitting**: What happens when models are too complex\n",
    "- ✅ **Basic linear algebra**: Understanding coefficients and regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you haven't completed these**, you might struggle with:\n",
    "- Understanding why regularization is needed\n",
    "- Knowing when to use Ridge vs Lasso\n",
    "- Understanding how alpha (regularization strength) works\n",

    "## 🔗 Where This Notebook Fits | مكان هذا الدفتر\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is Unit 2, Example 1** - it solves the overfitting problem from polynomial regression!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this example FIRST in Unit 2?**\n",
    "- **Before** you can use advanced techniques, you need to solve overfitting\n",
    "- **Before** you can build robust models, you need regularization\n",
    "- **Before** you can handle multicollinearity, you need Ridge/Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "**Builds on**: \n",
    "- 📓 Unit 1, Example 4: Linear Regression (we know basic regression)\n",
    "- 📓 Unit 1, Example 5: Polynomial Regression (we saw overfitting!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leads to**: \n",
    "- 📓 Example 2: Cross-Validation (evaluates models properly)\n",
    "- 📓 Unit 3: Classification (same regularization concepts apply)\n",
    "- 📓 All ML models (regularization is universal!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this order?**\n",
    "1. Ridge/Lasso solve **overfitting** (critical problem from Unit 1)\n",
    "2. Ridge/Lasso teach **regularization** (essential ML concept)\n",
    "3. Ridge/Lasso show **feature selection** (Lasso automatically selects features)\n",

    "## The Story: Preventing Overfitting | القصة: منع الإفراط في التلائم\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're learning to drive. **Before** regularization, you memorize every turn on the training route perfectly, but fail on new routes (overfitting). **After** regularization, you learn general driving principles that work everywhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with machine learning: **Before** Ridge/Lasso, models memorize training data perfectly but fail on new data. **After** Ridge/Lasso, models learn general patterns that generalize well!\n",

    "## Why Ridge and Lasso Matter | لماذا يهم ريدج ولاسو؟\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization prevents overfitting:\n",
    "- **Ridge (L2)**: Shrinks coefficients toward zero (keeps all features)\n",
    "- **Lasso (L1)**: Shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero (feature selection!)\n",
    "- **Both**: Prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients\n",
    "- **Alpha**: Controls regularization strength (higher = more regularization)\n",

    "## Learning Objectives | أهداف التعلم\n",
