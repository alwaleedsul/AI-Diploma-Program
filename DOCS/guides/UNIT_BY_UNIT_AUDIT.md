## Summary

- **60 units** mapped to DETAILED_UNIT_DESCRIPTIONS and repo paths.
- **Official paths:** Course 01 canonical units; 02 NOTEBOOKS; 03 modules; 04–12 unit folders.
- **Known mapping differences:** Course 08 (U4/U5 vs spec), Course 10 (GANs/VAEs/Applications/Ethics vs Text/Image/Ethics/Future). See [LEARNING_FLOW_ALIGNMENT_REPORT §5](../../LEARNING_FLOW_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md).

**Target state (no content reorg):** Course 08 — use unit folders as-is; spec U4 (Advanced DL) content lives in repo U5 or spread across U4/U5; mapping by position. Course 10 — use unit2-gans, unit3-vaes, unit4-applications, unit5-ethics as U2–U5; spec Text/Image/Ethics/Future mapped by position.

**Last updated:** Deep-dive execution; Phase 2 audit.
