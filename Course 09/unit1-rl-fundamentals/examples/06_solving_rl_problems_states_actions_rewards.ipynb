    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **States**: What the agent observes (observation space)\n",
    "   - Continuous states (CartPole: position, velocity, angle)\n",
    "   - Discrete states (FrozenLake: grid position)\n",
    "2. **Actions**: What the agent can do (action space)\n",
    "   - Discrete actions (CartPole: left/right, FrozenLake: up/down/left/right)\n",
    "   - Continuous actions (MountainCar: acceleration)\n",
    "3. **Rewards**: Feedback signals\n",
    "   - Dense rewards (CartPole: +1 per step)\n",
    "   - Sparse rewards (FrozenLake: +1 only at goal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Principles:\n",
    "- **States**: Include all relevant information for decision-making\n",
    "- **Actions**: Cover all possible behaviors the agent can take\n",
    "- **Rewards**: Provide clear feedback, shape learning, avoid hacking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Process:\n",
    "1. Reset environment (get initial state)\n",
    "2. Loop: Select action → Step environment → Receive reward → Update state\n",
    "3. Repeat until episode ends\n",
    "4. Reset and repeat for multiple episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Implement learning algorithms (Q-learning, policy gradients)\n",
    "- Train agents to maximize rewards\n",
    "- Evaluate performance across episodes\n",
