    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Q-Learning**: Off-policy TD learning algorithm\n",
    "   - Updates: Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[r + γ*max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]\n",
    "   - Uses Q-table for discrete states\n",
    "   - Epsilon-greedy exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FrozenLake**: Discrete grid-world environment\n",
    "   - Perfect for tabular Q-learning\n",
    "   - 16 states, 4 actions\n",
    "   - Slippery/unslippery variants\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CartPole**: Continuous state space\n",
    "   - Requires state discretization for Q-learning\n",
    "   - 4 continuous state variables → discrete bins\n",
    "   - Alternative: Use DQN for continuous states\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DQN**: Deep Q-Network\n",
    "   - Neural network approximates Q-function\n",
    "   - Handles high-dimensional/continuous states\n",
    "   - Experience replay and target networks for stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Highlights:\n",
    "- **Q-Learning**: Tabular method, fast for discrete problems\n",
    "- **State Discretization**: Convert continuous to discrete for Q-learning\n",
    "- **Epsilon Decay**: Reduce exploration over time\n",
    "- **DQN**: Deep learning extension for complex problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "- Start with high epsilon (exploration), decay over time\n",
    "- Tune learning rate (alpha) and discount factor (gamma)\n",
    "- Monitor learning curves and success rates\n",
    "- Use experience replay and target networks for DQN stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Unit 2: Advanced Q-learning (SARSA, TD methods)\n",
    "- Unit 3: Deep RL (DQN, Actor-Critic, PPO)\n",
    "- Unit 4: Exploration strategies\n",
    "- Unit 5: Advanced applications\n",
