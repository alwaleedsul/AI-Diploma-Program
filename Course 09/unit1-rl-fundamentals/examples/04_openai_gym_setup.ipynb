    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **OpenAI Gym**: Standard toolkit for RL environments\n",
    "2. **Environment Interface**: reset(), step(action), render()\n",
    "3. **Spaces**: Observation space and action space define valid inputs/outputs\n",
    "4. **Environments**: CartPole, FrozenLake, MountainCar, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Steps:\n",
    "1. Install: `pip install gym`\n",
    "2. Import: `import gym`\n",
    "3. Create: `env = gym.make('EnvironmentName-v1')`\n",
    "4. Interact: reset, step, render, close\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Environments:\n",
    "- **CartPole-v1**: Balance a pole on a cart\n",
    "- **FrozenLake-v1**: Navigate a frozen lake grid\n",
    "- **MountainCar-v0**: Drive a car up a hill\n",
    "- **LunarLander-v2**: Land a spaceship\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Implement RL algorithms (Q-learning, DQN)\n",
    "- Train agents in these environments\n",
    "- Compare algorithm performance\n",
