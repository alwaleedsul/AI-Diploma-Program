## Course Overview | نظرة عامة على الدورة

This course provides comprehensive training in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Students will learn to build agents that learn from interaction with environments through trial and error.

**Course Code:** AIAT 123  
**Language:** Bilingual (Arabic/English)
**Credit Hours:** 4  
**Lecture Hours:** 2  
**Practical Hours:** 4  
**Total Hours:** 96 (32 theoretical + 64 practical)

**Unit Breakdown:**
- Unit 1: 6 theoretical + 12 practical = 18 hours
- Unit 2: 6 theoretical + 13 practical = 19 hours
- Unit 3: 6 theoretical + 13 practical = 19 hours
- Unit 4: 7 theoretical + 13 practical = 20 hours
- Unit 5: 7 theoretical + 13 practical = 20 hours

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) | مخرجات التعلم

**The detailed objectives of the training program are: For the trainee to be able to:**

**CLO1:** Explain basic principles of reinforcement learning, including key concepts such as reward signals, agents, environments, and decision-making processes in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

**CLO2:** Apply reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning, policy gradient methods, and Actor-Critic approaches to solve decision-making problems.

**CLO3:** Implement deep reinforcement learning techniques using neural networks and explore their relationship with deep learning.

**CLO4:** Evaluate and improve reinforcement learning models by applying strategies to improve training efficiency and performance.

**CLO5:** Develop reinforcement learning-based solutions for real-world applications such as autonomous navigation, game playing, and optimization tasks.

**CLO6:** Critically analyze challenges and ethical considerations in reinforcement learning, including exploration vs exploitation strategies and safety concerns.
