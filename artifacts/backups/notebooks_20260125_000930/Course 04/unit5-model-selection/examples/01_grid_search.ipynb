    "**AFTER**: We'll use Grid Search and Random Search to automatically find the best hyperparameters!\n",

    "**Why this matters**: Hyperparameters dramatically affect model performance. Automatic tuning finds optimal values much better than manual guessing!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: Why not just use default hyperparameters?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Defaults are generic (work for average cases), but your data might need different values\n",
    "  - Example: Default C=1.0 for SVM might not be optimal → Grid Search finds best C for your data\n",
    "  - Tuning hyperparameters can improve accuracy by 5-20% (significant improvement!)\n",
    "- **Q: What's the difference between parameters and hyperparameters?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Parameters = learned from data (e.g., coefficients in linear regression)\n",
    "  - Hyperparameters = set before training (e.g., C, gamma, max_depth, learning_rate)\n",
    "  - Parameters are learned, hyperparameters are tuned!\n",
    "- **Q: Why use Grid Search instead of trying values manually?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Grid Search tries ALL combinations systematically → guaranteed to find best (within grid)\n",
    "  - Manual = might miss optimal values, slow, error-prone\n",
    "  - Grid Search = systematic, automatic, finds best combination\n",
    "- **Q: Why is Grid Search slow?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Grid Search tries ALL combinations → if you have 3 hyperparameters with 5 values each = 5×5×5 = 125 combinations\n",
    "  - Each combination needs cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold CV) → 125 × 5 = 625 model trainings!\n",
    "  - Solution: Use smaller grids or Random Search (tries random combinations, faster)\n",
    "- **Q: When should I use Grid Search vs Random Search?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Grid Search = thorough but slow (use when you have few hyperparameters or small grids)\n",
    "  - Random Search = faster, often finds good solutions (use when you have many hyperparameters or large grids)\n",
    "  - Rule of thumb: Start with Random Search, use Grid Search to fine-tune around best Random Search result\n"

    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between parameters and hyperparameters?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Parameters**: Learned from data during training (e.g., coefficients in linear regression, weights in neural networks)\n",
    "  - **Hyperparameters**: Set before training, control model behavior (e.g., C, gamma, max_depth, learning_rate)\n",
    "  - **Key difference**: Parameters are learned, hyperparameters are tuned\n",
    "  - **Example**: In SVM, C and gamma are hyperparameters (you set them), support vectors are parameters (model learns them)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why not just use default hyperparameters?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Defaults are generic (work for average cases), but your data might need different values:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Defaults may not be optimal for your specific dataset\n",
    "  - **Example**: Default C=1.0 for SVM might not be optimal → Grid Search finds best C for your data\n",
    "  - **Impact**: Tuning hyperparameters can improve accuracy by 5-20% (significant improvement!)\n",
    "  - **Rule**: Always tune hyperparameters for best performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between Grid Search and Random Search?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Grid Search**: Tries ALL combinations systematically (thorough but slow)\n",
    "  - **Random Search**: Tries random combinations (faster, often finds good solutions)\n",
    "  - **Grid Search**: Guaranteed to find best (within grid), but slow for large grids\n",
    "  - **Random Search**: Faster, often finds good solutions quickly, but may miss optimal\n",
    "  - **Use Grid Search**: When you have few hyperparameters or small grids\n",
    "  - **Use Random Search**: When you have many hyperparameters or large grids\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why is Grid Search slow?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Grid Search tries ALL combinations:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: If you have 3 hyperparameters with 5 values each = 5×5×5 = 125 combinations\n",
    "  - **Issue**: Each combination needs cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold CV) → 125 × 5 = 625 model trainings!\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Use smaller grids or Random Search (tries random combinations, faster)\n",
    "  - **Tip**: Start with coarse grid, then fine-tune around best result\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I choose which hyperparameters to tune?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Focus on hyperparameters that most affect performance:\n",
    "  - **SVM**: C (regularization), gamma (kernel influence)\n",
    "  - **Random Forest**: n_estimators (number of trees), max_depth (tree depth)\n",
    "  - **Neural Networks**: learning_rate, batch_size, number of layers\n",
    "  - **Rule**: Start with 2-3 most important hyperparameters, add more if needed\n",
    "  - **Tip**: Use domain knowledge or documentation to identify important hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How many combinations should I try in Grid Search?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Balance between thoroughness and speed:\n",
    "  - **Small grid**: 2-3 values per hyperparameter (fast, may miss optimal)\n",
    "  - **Medium grid**: 4-5 values per hyperparameter (balanced)\n",
    "  - **Large grid**: 10+ values per hyperparameter (slow, thorough)\n",
    "  - **Rule of thumb**: Start with 3-5 values per hyperparameter, total < 100 combinations\n",
    "  - **Tip**: Use Random Search for large grids, then fine-tune with Grid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What scoring metric should I use for hyperparameter tuning?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Use the metric that matters for your problem:\n",
    "  - **Classification**: accuracy (default), precision, recall, F1, AUC\n",
    "  - **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²\n",
    "  - **Imbalanced data**: Use F1 or AUC instead of accuracy\n",
    "  - **Rule**: Use the same metric you'll use for final evaluation\n",
    "  - **Tip**: Can use multiple metrics, but optimize for one primary metric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use Grid Search without cross-validation?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **Not recommended!** Cross-validation is essential:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Without CV, you might overfit to training data\n",
    "  - **Issue**: Hyperparameters that work well on training data may not generalize\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Always use cross-validation (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)\n",
    "  - **Rule**: CV gives reliable estimate of performance, prevents overfitting\n",
    "  - **Note**: GridSearchCV automatically uses cross-validation (that's what \"CV\" means!)\n",
