    "**As computer science students, you'll work with many different types of datasets** (medical, financial, security, e-commerce, etc.). **What matters is the data structure, not the domain knowledge!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure Focus**:\n",
    "- **Data Shape**: 891 rows × 12 columns (passenger records × features)\n",
    "- **Feature Types**: Mixed (numerical: Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch; categorical: Sex, Embarked, Pclass; text: Name, Ticket, Cabin)\n",
    "- **Target Type**: Exploratory analysis (understanding passenger patterns - reframed as investigation evidence)\n",
    "- **Task**: Clean passenger data for analysis and modeling (reframed as investigation evidence reports)\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Has natural missing values (Age: ~20%, Cabin: ~77%, Embarked: ~0.2%) - perfect for learning cleaning!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Structure Matters**:\n",
    "- **Mixed feature types** → Need different cleaning methods (numeric vs. categorical)\n",
    "- **Missing values present** → Real-world scenario (most datasets have missing values)\n",
    "- **Real historical data** → Shows actual data quality issues (not synthetic!)\n",
    "- **Different data types** → Need different handling (numeric: Age → mean/median, categorical: Embarked → mode)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?** \n",
    "- **For choosing cleaning methods**: Missing Age → use mean/median (numeric), Missing Embarked → use mode (categorical)\n",
    "- **For outlier detection**: Age should be 0-120, Fare should be reasonable\n",
    "- **For data types**: Age should be numeric (not text), Sex/Embarked should be categorical\n",
    "- **For high missing percentage**: Cabin has 77% missing - might need special handling (remove column or create indicator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Context** (Brief - Reframed for GDI):\n",
    "- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each record (like evidence_id)\n",
    "- **Survived**: Survival status (binary: 0 or 1 - like evidence status)\n",
    "- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, 3 - categorical, like priority level)\n",
    "- **Name**: Passenger name (text - like evidence identifier)\n",
    "- **Sex**: Gender (categorical: male/female - like evidence category)\n",
    "- **Age**: Passenger age (numerical, ~20% missing - like evidence age/date)\n",
    "- **SibSp**: Siblings/Spouses aboard (numerical)\n",
    "- **Parch**: Parents/Children aboard (numerical)\n",
    "- **Ticket**: Ticket number (text)\n",
    "- **Fare**: Ticket fare (numerical - like evidence value)\n",
