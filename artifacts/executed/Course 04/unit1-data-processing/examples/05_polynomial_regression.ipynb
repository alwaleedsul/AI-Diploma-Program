    "Imagine you're analyzing traffic accident data for traffic management. **Before** using polynomial regression, you try a straight line to predict accident impact distance from visibility, but it doesn't capture the reality - as visibility decreases, accident distances increase, but not in a straight line! The relationship is CURVED - very low visibility leads to exponentially longer accident distances! **After** learning polynomial regression, you use curves that follow the data naturally - much better fit for traffic management decision-making!\n",

    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: Why use polynomial regression instead of linear regression?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Linear regression only handles straight lines, polynomial handles curves\n",
    "  - Problem: Real-world data often has curved relationships (e.g., price vs size - diminishing returns)\n",
    "  - Solution: Polynomial regression adds x², x³ terms → can model curves\n",
    "  - Use polynomial when: Data shows curved pattern, linear regression has poor fit\n",
    "- **Q: What is polynomial degree?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Degree = highest power of x (degree 2 = x², degree 3 = x³)\n",
    "  - Degree 1: Straight line (same as linear regression)\n",
    "  - Degree 2: Parabola (one curve)\n",
    "  - Degree 3: S-curve (two curves)\n",
    "  - Higher degree = more curves = more flexible but can overfit\n",
    "- **Q: Why does polynomial regression overfit so easily?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Higher degree = more parameters = model can fit training data perfectly\n",
    "  - Problem: Fits training data too well → fails on new data\n",
    "  - Example: Degree 10 can fit 10 points perfectly but terrible on new data\n",
    "  - Solution: Use lower degree, or use Ridge/Lasso (Unit 2) to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Q: How do I choose the right polynomial degree?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Try different degrees (2, 3, 4, 5) and compare train vs test performance\n",
    "  - Good degree: Train and test performance both good (small gap)\n",
    "  - Too high: Train performance great, test performance poor (overfitting)\n",
    "  - Too low: Both train and test performance poor (underfitting)\n",
    "  - Rule of thumb: Start with degree 2, increase if needed, stop when test performance drops\n",
    "- **Q: When should I use polynomial regression?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Use when:\n",
    "  - Data shows curved relationship (not straight line)\n",
    "  - Linear regression has poor fit (low R²)\n",
    "  - You understand the relationship is non-linear\n",

    "\n",
    "**Data Structure Focus**:\n",
    "- **Data Shape**: Variable rows × 2 columns (samples × features) - sampled from full dataset\n",
    "- **Feature Types**: All numerical (float64) - continuous values\n",
    "- **Target Type**: Regression (predicting continuous value: Distance in miles)\n",
    "- **Task**: Predict accident impact distance (miles) based on visibility conditions\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Real-world traffic accident data with non-linear relationship (curved, not linear)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Structure Matters**:\n",
    "- **Non-linear relationship** → Need polynomial regression (not linear regression)\n",
    "- **Regression task** → We'll use regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)\n",
    "- **Real-world data** → Shows why polynomial regression is needed (curved patterns)\n",

    "- **For degree selection**: Need to find optimal polynomial degree (2, 3, 4, etc.)\n",
    "- **For evaluation**: Continuous target → use regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Context** (Brief) - GDI Traffic Management:\n",
    "- **Visibility(mi)**: Visibility distance in miles during the accident (higher = clearer conditions)\n",
    "- **Distance(mi)**: Accident impact distance in miles - how far traffic is affected (higher = more disruption)\n",
    "- **Relationship**: Curved - as visibility decreases, impact distance increases, but not linearly\n",
    "  - High visibility: Impact distances are small and stable\n",
    "  - Low visibility: Impact distances increase exponentially (non-linear escalation)\n",

    "- Understanding the **data structure** (rows, columns, types, relationship shape)\n",
    "- Knowing the **task type** (regression: predicting continuous values)\n",
