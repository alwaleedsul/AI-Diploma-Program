    "\n",
    "**BEFORE**: We have all our data (features X and target y), but we can't use all of it for training!\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER**: We'll split data into training set (80%) and test set (20%) to properly evaluate our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why split data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem**: If we train AND test on the same data, the model will \"memorize\" the data instead of learning patterns!\n",
    "- **Example**: Like a student who memorizes answers to specific questions\n",
    "- **Result**: Model gets perfect scores on training data, but fails on new data\n",
    "- **This is called \"Overfitting\"** - model memorizes instead of learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: Split data into TWO separate sets:\n",
    "1. **Training Set (X_train, y_train)** - 80% of data\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Model LEARNS from this data\n",
    "   - **What happens**: Model sees features (X_train) and correct answers (y_train)\n",
    "   - **Process**: Model finds the best line that fits this data\n",
    "   - **Like**: Student studying from a textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Set (X_test, y_test)** - 20% of data\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Model is EVALUATED on this data\n",
    "   - **What happens**: Model sees features (X_test) but NOT answers (y_test)\n",
    "   - **Process**: Model makes predictions, we compare with actual answers\n",
    "   - **Like**: Student taking an exam (unseen questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- Model learns patterns from training data (not memorizing)\n",
    "- Test data is \"unseen\" - model hasn't seen it during training\n",
    "- If model performs well on test data → model learned general patterns!\n",
    "- If model performs poorly on test data → model overfitted (memorized training data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test?**\n",
    "- **X_train**: Training features (inputs) - what model learns from\n",
    "- **y_train**: Training targets (outputs) - correct answers for training\n",
    "- **X_test**: Test features (inputs) - what model predicts on\n",
    "- **y_test**: Test targets (outputs) - correct answers for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why 80/20 split?**\n",
    "- Good balance - need enough training data (80%) to learn, enough test data (20%) to evaluate\n",
    "- Can adjust: Small datasets (<1000) → 70/30, Large datasets (>10k) → 90/10\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can I use test data for training?**\n",
    "- NO! Never use test data for training - this defeats the purpose!\n",
    "- Problem: If model sees test data during training, it's not a fair test\n",
    "- Rule: Test data should be \"locked away\" until final evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if I need more training data?**\n",
    "- Use cross-validation (Unit 2) - splits data multiple ways without wasting test set\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why split X and y separately?**\n",
    "- X (features) and y (target) must stay together!\n",
    "- Each row in X_train corresponds to same row in y_train\n",
    "- train_test_split keeps them aligned automatically"

    "\n",
    "### For CS Students - Focus on Data Structure, Not Domain | للطلاب في علوم الحاسوب - ركز على هيكل البيانات، وليس المجال\n",
    "\n",
    "**As computer science students, you'll work with many different types of datasets** (medical, financial, e-commerce, etc.). **What matters is the data structure, not the domain knowledge!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structure Focus**:\n",
    "- **Data Shape**: ~5,000 rows × 2 columns (transaction records × features)\n",
    "  - Note: Using a sample for learning convenience (faster execution)\n",
    "  - Full dataset has ~284,000 rows\n",
    "- **Feature Types**: All numerical (float64) - continuous values\n",
    "- **Target Type**: Regression (predicting continuous value: transaction amount)\n",
    "- **Task**: Predict transaction amount (Amount) based on time elapsed (Time)\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Real anonymized credit card transaction data (perfect for learning!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Structure Matters**:\n",
    "- **Simple structure** → Easy to understand (2 columns: Time, Amount)\n",
    "- **Regression task** → Predicting continuous value (Amount) from feature (Time)\n",
    "- **Real-world data** → Actual anonymized credit card transaction data\n",
    "- **Linear regression** → Simple model: Amount = slope × Time + intercept\n",
    "- **Metrics** → We'll use regression metrics (MSE, MAE, R²)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Dataset Domain (Brief) | فهم مجال مجموعة البيانات (باختصار)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this data?** Real-world financial transaction data - account balances and transaction amounts, relevant to GDI financial investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?** \n",
    "- **For model selection**: Predicting transaction amounts (continuous) → use regression (not classification)\n",
    "- **For feature selection**: One feature (Time) → simple linear regression\n",
    "- **For evaluation**: Continuous target → use regression metrics (MSE, MAE, R²)\n",
    "- **For GDI work**: Understanding transaction patterns helps identify suspicious financial activities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Context** (Brief):\n",
    "- **Time**: Time elapsed between transaction and first transaction (seconds) - predictor variable\n",
    "- **Amount**: Transaction amount in dollars (target variable)\n",
    "- **Relationship**: We're modeling how transaction amount relates to time of day/sequence\n",
    "- **GDI Application**: Financial investigations analyze transaction patterns (amount vs. time) to identify suspicious activities\n",
    "- **Important Note**: This is a SIMPLIFIED model for learning purposes. \n",
    "  - **Expected Performance**: Time alone is NOT a strong predictor of Amount (we'll see low/negative R²)\n",
    "  - **Why simplified?**: To teach the basics of linear regression step-by-step\n",
    "  - **Real GDI Work**: Uses multiple features (V1-V28, transaction history, account patterns, etc.) for accurate fraud detection\n",
    "  - **Next Step**: In Part 2 (Multiple Regression), we'll add more features for better predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Important: Why Low Performance is EXPECTED (Not a Problem!)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder: \"The R² will be very low/negative - did we choose the wrong dataset or model?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: NO! This is INTENTIONAL and EXPECTED for learning purposes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why Time Alone?**\n",
    "   - We use ONE feature (Time) to teach SIMPLE regression first\n",
    "   - This makes it easy to visualize and understand (2D plot: Time vs Amount)\n",
    "   - Simple models are easier to learn than complex ones\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why Low R² is Expected:**\n",
    "   - Time (seconds elapsed) doesn't strongly predict transaction Amount\n",
    "   - Transaction amounts depend on MANY factors (customer behavior, merchant type, etc.)\n",
    "   - One feature alone rarely captures complex patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **This is a TEACHING STRATEGY:**\n",
    "   - Start simple → see limitations → extend to multiple features\n",
    "   - Shows WHY we need multiple regression (Part 2)\n",
    "   - Demonstrates the progression from simple to complex models\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Context:**\n",
    "   - In real GDI work, fraud detection uses 10+ features (V1-V28, transaction patterns, etc.)\n",
    "   - We'll see better performance in Part 2 when we add more features\n",
    "   - This progression mirrors how ML is learned: simple → complex\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Low R² here doesn't mean we chose wrong - it means we're learning step-by-step!\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Key Point for CS Students**: You don't need to be a financial expert! Focus on:\n",
    "- Understanding the **data structure** (rows, columns, types)\n",
    "- Knowing the **task type** (regression: predicting continuous values)\n",
    "- Choosing the right **algorithms and metrics** based on structure, not domain knowledge\n"

    "\n",
    "**BEFORE**: We have data with multiple columns, but we need to separate what we use to predict (features) from what we want to predict (target).\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER**: We'll prepare X (features) and y (target) for the model!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why 4 features for X and 1 feature for y?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X (Features) = Multiple inputs** that affect transaction amount:\n",
    "  - `account_balance`: Account balance affects transaction amount (higher balance = typically larger transactions)\n",
    "  - `account_age`: Account age affects patterns (older accounts may have different transaction patterns)\n",
    "  - `transaction_frequency`: Frequency affects amount (more frequent = may have different amounts)\n",
    "  - `risk_score`: Risk score affects amount (higher risk = may indicate suspicious patterns)\n",
    "  - We use **MULTIPLE features** because transaction amount depends on **MANY factors**!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **y (Target) = Single output** we want to predict:\n",
    "  - `transaction_amount`: The **ONE thing** we're trying to predict (transaction amount)\n",
    "  - We predict **ONE value** (transaction amount) from **MULTIPLE inputs** (features)\n",
    "  - This is the standard ML pattern: **Multiple inputs → Single output**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Transaction Amount = intercept + (coef1 × Account Balance) + (coef2 × Account Age)\n",
    " + (coef3 × Transaction Frequency) + (coef4 × Risk Score)\n",
    "y = b₀ + (b₁ × x₁) + (b₂ × x₂) + (b₃ × x₃) + (b₄ × x₄)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if I want to predict MORE than one target?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have **TWO options**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Build SEPARATE models** (one for each target) - **Recommended for beginners**\n",
    "   - Model 1: Predict `transaction_amount` from features → y₁ = transaction_amount\n",
    "   - Model 2: Predict `risk_level` from features → y₂ = risk_level\n",
    "   - **Why?** Each target might depend on features differently\n",
    "   - **Example**: Transaction amount might depend more on account balance, risk level might depend more on transaction frequency\n",
    "   - This is called \"Multi-Output Regression\" (separate models)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Multi-Output Regression** (one model, multiple outputs)\n",
    "   - `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()` can handle multiple targets\n",
    "   - `y = [[amount1, risk1], [amount2, risk2], ...]` (2D array with multiple columns)\n",
    "   - Model learns separate coefficients for each target\n",
    "   - **Formula**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     transaction_amount = b₀₁ + b₁₁×account_balance + b₂₁×account_age + ...\n",
    "     risk_level        = b₀₂ + b₁₂×account_balance + b₂₂×account_age + ...\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Use when**: Targets are related and you want one model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**: Start with **separate models** (easier to understand and interpret). Use multi-output only if targets are strongly related."

    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between simple and multiple linear regression?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Simple**: Uses ONE feature to predict target (e.g., size → price)\n",
    "  - **Multiple**: Uses MULTIPLE features to predict target (e.g., size + age + rooms → price)\n",
    "  - **Same concept**: Both find a line, but multiple regression is in higher dimensions\n",
    "  - **Formula**: Simple: y = mx + b, Multiple: y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What do the coefficients mean?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Coefficients show how much the target changes when a feature increases by 1 unit:\n",
    "  - **Example**: Coefficient = 0.05 for size means: \"For every 1 sq ft increase, price increases by $0.05\"\n",
    "  - **Larger coefficient** = Feature has more impact on predictions\n",
    "  - **Positive coefficient** = Feature increases target\n",
    "  - **Negative coefficient** = Feature decreases target\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's a good R² score?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: It depends on your problem:\n",
    "  - **R² > 0.9**: Excellent (model explains >90% of variance)\n",
    "  - **R² > 0.7**: Good (model explains >70% of variance)\n",
    "  - **R² > 0.5**: Fair (model explains >50% of variance)\n",
    "  - **R² < 0.5**: Poor (model explains <50% of variance)\n",
    "  - **Note**: For real-world problems, R² > 0.7 is generally considered good\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do we need both MSE and MAE?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: They measure different aspects:\n",
    "  - **MSE**: Penalizes large errors more (squared term) - use when large errors are very bad\n",
    "  - **MAE**: Average error in same units as target - easier to interpret\n",
    "  - **Example**: MSE = $10,000², MAE = $100 → \"Average error is $100\" (MAE is clearer!)\n",
    "  - **Use both**: MSE for optimization, MAE for interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if my model has high training R² but low test R²?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: This is **overfitting** - model memorized training data:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Model learned training patterns too well, can't generalize\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Use regularization (Ridge/Lasso), get more data, or simplify model\n",
    "  - **Check**: If train R² >> test R² → overfitting detected!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use linear regression for classification?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **NO!** Linear regression predicts continuous values (numbers), not categories:\n",
    "  - **Regression**: Predicts numbers (price, temperature, sales)\n",
    "  - **Classification**: Predicts categories (yes/no, A/B/C, sick/healthy)\n",
    "  - **Use instead**: Logistic Regression for classification (Unit 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What if my data isn't linear?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Linear regression won't work well:\n",
    "  - **Check**: Plot your data - if it's curved, not linear\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Use Polynomial Regression (Example 5) or other non-linear models\n",
    "  - **Sign**: Low R², curved residuals pattern → need non-linear model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I know if my model is good enough?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Check multiple things:\n",
    "  - **R² > 0.7**: Good overall fit\n",
    "  - **Train R² ≈ Test R²**: Good generalization (no overfitting)\n",
    "  - **Residuals random**: No patterns (good model)\n",

    "  - **R² (R-squared)**: Proportion of variance explained (0 to 1, higher is better, 1 = perfect fit)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Residual Analysis**: Residuals (errors) should be randomly distributed around zero. Patterns in residuals indicate model problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Coefficients show how much each feature affects the prediction. Larger absolute coefficients = more important features.\n",
