    "## ❓ Common Student Questions | الأسئلة الشائعة للطلاب\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the difference between Ridge and Lasso?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Ridge (L2)**: Shrinks ALL coefficients toward zero, but keeps all features (no feature selection)\n",
    "  - **Lasso (L1)**: Shrinks some coefficients to EXACTLY zero (removes features - automatic feature selection!)\n",
    "  - **Key difference**: Ridge keeps all features, Lasso removes some features\n",
    "  - **Use Ridge**: When all features might be important, or multicollinearity present\n",
    "  - **Use Lasso**: When you need feature selection, or expect sparse solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is alpha and how do I choose it?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Alpha controls regularization strength:\n",
    "  - **Alpha = 0**: No regularization (same as Linear Regression)\n",
    "  - **Alpha = small (0.01, 0.1)**: Light regularization (slight shrinkage)\n",
    "  - **Alpha = large (1, 10, 100)**: Strong regularization (heavy shrinkage)\n",
    "  - **How to choose**: Use cross-validation (Unit 2, Example 2) to find optimal alpha\n",
    "  - **Rule of thumb**: Start with alpha=1, try 0.1, 1, 10, 100, pick best\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do I need to scale features before regularization?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Regularization penalizes large coefficients:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: If features have different scales (age: 0-100, income: 0-100000), coefficients will be different sizes\n",
    "  - **Issue**: Regularization will unfairly penalize features with larger scales\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Scale all features to same range (StandardScaler) → fair regularization\n",
    "  - **Rule**: ALWAYS scale features before Ridge/Lasso!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When should I use Ridge vs Lasso?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: \n",
    "  - **Use Ridge**: Multicollinearity present, all features might be important, want to keep all features\n",
    "  - **Use Lasso**: Need feature selection, many features (some noise), expect sparse solution\n",
    "  - **Try both**: Compare performance, pick the one that works better for your data\n",
    "  - **Elastic Net**: Combines both (advanced, not covered here)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Does regularization always improve performance?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **Not always!** It depends:\n",
    "  - **If overfitting**: Regularization helps (reduces overfitting, improves test performance)\n",
    "  - **If no overfitting**: Regularization might hurt (unnecessary shrinkage)\n",
    "  - **Check**: Compare train vs test R² - if similar, regularization might not help\n",
    "  - **Rule**: Use regularization when train R² >> test R² (overfitting detected)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What happens if alpha is too high?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **Underfitting** - model becomes too simple:\n",
    "  - **Problem**: Coefficients shrink too much → model can't capture patterns\n",
    "  - **Sign**: Both train and test R² are low (model too simple)\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Decrease alpha (try 0.1, 0.01, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Balance**: Need alpha high enough to prevent overfitting, but not too high to cause underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use Ridge/Lasso for classification?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: **Yes!** Regularization works for both regression and classification:\n",
    "  - **Ridge/Lasso Regression**: For continuous targets (prices, temperatures)\n",
    "  - **Ridge/Lasso Logistic Regression**: For categorical targets (yes/no, classes)\n",
    "  - **Same concept**: Regularization prevents overfitting in both cases\n",
    "  - **We'll see this**: In Unit 3 (Classification) with regularized logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I know if regularization helped?**\n",
    "- **Answer**: Compare before and after:\n",
    "  - **Before (Linear Regression)**: Train R² = 0.95, Test R² = 0.75 (overfitting!)\n",
    "  - **After (Ridge/Lasso)**: Train R² = 0.85, Test R² = 0.82 (better generalization!)\n",
    "  - **Good sign**: Test R² improved, train-test gap reduced\n",
    "  - **Bad sign**: Both train and test R² decreased (alpha too high, underfitting)\n",
