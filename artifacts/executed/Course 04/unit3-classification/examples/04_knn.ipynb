    "## What is KNN? | ما هو KNN؟\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a classification algorithm that makes predictions by finding the K closest data points (neighbors) and using majority vote.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How KNN Works | كيف يعمل KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store All Data**: KNN stores all training data (no model training!)\n",
    "2. **For New Point**: When predicting, find the K nearest neighbors\n",
    "3. **Calculate Distances**: Measure distance to all training points\n",
    "4. **Select K Nearest**: Pick the K closest points\n",
    "5. **Vote**: Majority class of K neighbors = prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example | مثال بسيط\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting if a transaction is fraud:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "New Transaction: [Amount=$500, Time=1200, ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Calculate distances to all training transactions\n",
    "Step 2: Find 5 nearest neighbors (K=5)\n",
    "  - Neighbor 1: Fraud ✅ (distance: 0.5)\n",
    "  - Neighbor 2: Legitimate ❌ (distance: 0.7)\n",
    "  - Neighbor 3: Fraud ✅ (distance: 0.8)\n",
    "  - Neighbor 4: Fraud ✅ (distance: 0.9)\n",
    "  - Neighbor 5: Legitimate ❌ (distance: 1.0)\n",

    "### What We Learned | ما تعلمناه\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KNN Basics**: KNN finds K nearest neighbors and predicts based on majority vote\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling**: CRITICAL for KNN - always use StandardScaler!\n",
    "3. **Choosing K**: Balance between overfitting (small K) and underfitting (large K)\n",
    "4. **Lazy Learning**: KNN doesn't train a model - all computation happens during prediction\n",

    "### Key Takeaways | النقاط الرئيسية\n",
    "\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Always scale features before KNN** - distance calculations depend on feature scales\n",
    "- 🎯 **Choose K carefully** - too small = overfitting, too large = underfitting\n",
    "- 💡 **KNN is simple but powerful** - often performs well with proper preprocessing\n",
    "- 📊 **Evaluate comprehensively** - use accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, confusion matrix\n",
    "- 🔍 **Understand trade-offs** - KNN is slow for large datasets but simple to understand\n",
