    "Imagine you're deploying an AI system and face a legal issue. **Before** understanding legal challenges, you wouldn't know how to handle liability or regulatory conflicts (legal risk!). **After** learning legal challenges, you understand liability attribution, regulatory conflicts, cross-border issues - legal navigation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with AI: **Before** we have regulations and governance but don't understand legal challenges, now we learn legal challenges - navigate liability, handle conflicts, understand responsibilities! **After** legal challenges, we can navigate the legal landscape!\n",

    "## Why Legal Challenges Matter | لماذا تهم التحديات القانونية؟\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding legal challenges is essential for ethical AI:\n",
    "- **Liability**: Understand who is responsible for AI decisions\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Navigate regulatory conflicts\n",
    "- **Protection**: Protect against legal risks\n",
    "- **Trust**: Build stakeholder confidence through legal understanding\n",
    "- **Ethics**: Ensure ethical AI through legal compliance\n",
