    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you've mastered the fundamental mathematical structures that power all machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vectors and Matrices**: You learned that all data in ML is represented as vectors (single data points) and matrices (collections of data points). Each row represents a sample, and each column represents a feature. This structure enables efficient batch processing in ML algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matrix Operations**: You discovered that matrix multiplication is the core operation in neural networks. The dot product (`@` operator) transforms data through layers, and understanding matrix dimensions is crucial for debugging ML code. Transpose operations help align data for different computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Linear Transformations**: You saw how matrices can rotate, scale, and transform data. These transformations are fundamental to feature engineering, data preprocessing, and understanding how neural network layers transform input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors**: You learned that eigenvalues represent how much a transformation stretches or compresses data, while eigenvectors show the principal directions. This concept is the mathematical foundation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that you'll use in Module 04.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 How This Connects to Future Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned here will be used in:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module 02**: Vectors → Gradient vectors | Matrices → Jacobian matrices\n",
    "- **Module 03**: Matrix operations → Efficient optimizer computations\n",
    "- **Module 04**: Eigenvalues/eigenvectors → Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "- **Module 05**: Data representation → Probabilistic models\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Remember**: Linear algebra is the foundation. Every ML algorithm uses these concepts!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete the exercises in the `exercises/` folder\n",
    "2. Review the solutions if needed\n",
    "3. Move on to **Module 02: Calculus and Multivariable Calculus for Machine Learning**\n",
    "   - You'll learn how derivatives and gradients work, building on linear algebra concepts\n",
    "   - **Connection**: Gradients are vectors, and you'll use matrix operations to compute them!\n",
