    "### Why does Calculus matter for Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculus is essential for training machine learning models. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: ML models are trained by minimizing loss functions using derivatives\n",
    "- **Gradients**: Gradients tell us which direction to adjust parameters to reduce error\n",
    "- **Backpropagation**: Neural networks use the chain rule to compute gradients through layers\n",
    "- **Learning Rate**: Understanding derivatives helps tune learning rates effectively\n",
    "- **Convergence**: Calculus helps understand when and how models converge to optimal solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Neural Network Training**: Backpropagation relies entirely on calculus\n",
    "- **Gradient Descent**: The most fundamental optimization algorithm in ML\n",
    "- **Loss Function Minimization**: All supervised learning uses derivatives\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Understanding gradients helps optimize hyperparameters\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Derivatives help understand feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Instructor Note**: You can add more domain-specific examples from your slides here, such as:\n",
    "> - Neural network training: Backpropagation uses chain rule\n",
    "> - Hyperparameter tuning: Learning rate affects gradient descent convergence\n",

    "\n",
    "In this module, you've learned the mathematical tools that enable machine learning models to learn from data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Derivatives and Gradients**: You discovered that derivatives tell us the direction to minimize loss functions. A positive derivative means the function is increasing (move left), while negative means decreasing (move right). Gradients extend this to multiple dimensions - they're vectors pointing in the direction of steepest increase, and the negative gradient points toward the minimum we want to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Descent**: You learned the fundamental optimization algorithm used in all ML training. Starting from random parameters, we iteratively move in the direction opposite to the gradient (steepest descent) with a learning rate controlling step size. This simple algorithm is the foundation of how neural networks learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chain Rule**: You understood how to compute derivatives of composite functions by multiplying derivatives through each layer. This is exactly what backpropagation does in neural networks - it uses the chain rule to compute gradients through all layers, allowing deep networks to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multivariable Calculus**: You saw that ML models have many parameters (weights), so we need partial derivatives for each. The gradient vector contains all partial derivatives, giving us the direction to update all parameters simultaneously. This enables efficient training of complex models.\n",
