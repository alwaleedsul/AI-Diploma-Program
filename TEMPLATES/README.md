# Templates (Instructor Only)

These files are **templates for instructors** to create units, exercises, and assessments.

**Students should not use these directly.**

If you are preparing student materials, copy the template into the target course/unit
and replace all placeholders like `[Unit Name]`, `[concept]`, and `[skill]`.
