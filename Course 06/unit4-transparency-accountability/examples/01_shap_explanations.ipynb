    "\n",
    "We've learned SHAP for explaining model predictions. **But there's still a challenge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if we need a simpler, faster explanation method that works with any model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP works well when:\n",
    "- ✅ We need mathematically rigorous explanations\n",
    "- ✅ We can afford computational cost\n",
    "- ✅ We want feature importance based on game theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**But sometimes we need:**\n",
    "- ❌ **Faster explanations** (SHAP can be slow for large datasets)\n",
    "- ❌ **Simpler methods** (easier to understand and implement)\n",
    "- ❌ **Model-agnostic approaches** (work with any black-box model)\n",
    "- ❌ **Local explanations** (explain individual predictions quickly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Is a Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When SHAP is too slow or complex:\n",
    "- We may need faster explanations for real-time systems\n",
    "- We may want simpler methods for non-technical users\n",
    "- We may need alternatives for different use cases\n",
    "- We may want to compare different explanation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: LIME Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "We need **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to:\n",
    "1. Provide fast local explanations\n",
    "2. Work with any black-box model\n",
    "3. Offer simpler, more intuitive explanations\n",
    "4. Enable real-time explainability\n",
