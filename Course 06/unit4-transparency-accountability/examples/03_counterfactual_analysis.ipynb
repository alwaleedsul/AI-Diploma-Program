    "- ✅ We can generate \"what if\" scenarios\n",
    "- ✅ We can provide actionable guidance\n",

    "- ❌ **Accountability frameworks** (who is responsible?)\n",
    "- ❌ **Responsibility mechanisms** (how to assign responsibility?)\n",
    "- ❌ **Audit trails** (how to track decisions?)\n",
    "- ❌ **Stakeholder accountability** (who answers for outcomes?)\n",

    "### Why This Is a Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have explanations but no accountability:\n",
    "- We may not know who is responsible for AI decisions\n",
