## Safety Procedures | إجراءات السلامة

**Important:** Please review the safety procedures before starting any lab work or practical exercises.

**مهم:** يرجى مراجعة إجراءات السلامة قبل بدء أي عمل مخبري أو تمارين عملية.

📖 **Full Safety Guide:** See `../DOCS/SAFETY_PROCEDURES.md` for complete safety procedures and requirements.

**Key Safety Rules:**
- ✅ Maintain clean, organized workspace
- ✅ Keep food and drinks away from equipment
- ✅ Know locations of fire extinguishers and first aid tools
- ✅ Report safety concerns immediately

## Prerequisites | المتطلبات الأساسية

**Python Version**: Python 3.8+ required (3.10 or 3.11 recommended)

**Knowledge**: Students should have:
- Completion of Courses 01-09
- Strong understanding of deep learning
- Familiarity with neural networks

**Hardware**: 
- **GPU strongly recommended** for generative AI (GANs, VAEs, Stable Diffusion)
- **Training on CPU is extremely slow** (can take days/weeks)
- **Use Google Colab for free GPU access!** (See `DOCS/COLAB_SETUP.md`)

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) | مخرجات التعلم

**The detailed objectives of the training program are: For the trainee to be able to:**

**CLO1:** Explain basic principles of generative AI, including probabilistic modeling, neural network structures, and key concepts.

**CLO2:** Apply generative modeling techniques such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformer-based models.

**CLO3:** Implement and optimize generative models using frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for tasks such as text generation, image synthesis, and audio creation.

**CLO4:** Evaluate generative model performance using quantitative metrics (such as FID, BLEU, and perplexity) and qualitative assessments, addressing challenges such as mode collapse.

**CLO5:** Design and develop generative AI-based solutions for practical applications, including automatic content generation, data augmentation, and creative applications.

**CLO6:** Analyze ethical, legal, and social implications of generative AI, including issues related to bias, misinformation, intellectual property rights, and transparency requirements.

**CLO7:** Explore emerging trends and future developments in generative AI, such as multimodal generation, diffusion models, and their impacts.
