    "3. **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: Multiple layers of neurons, can learn complex non-linear patterns\n",
    "4. **TensorFlow/Keras**: High-level API, easier to use, great for rapid prototyping\n",
    "5. **PyTorch**: More flexible, imperative style, better for research and custom architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framework Comparison:\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: Industry standard, production-ready, extensive ecosystem\n",
    "- **PyTorch**: Research-friendly, dynamic computation graphs, intuitive API\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use:\n",
    "- **TensorFlow**: Production deployment, large-scale systems, when you need TF Serving\n",
    "- **PyTorch**: Research, experimentation, when you need dynamic graphs\n",
