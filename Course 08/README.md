## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) | مخرجات التعلم

**The detailed objectives of the training program are: For the trainee to be able to:**

**CLO1:** Explain basic concepts of deep learning, including the structure and performance of neural networks, backpropagation algorithm, and optimization techniques.

**CLO2:** Develop and implement deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers.

**CLO3:** Build and deploy deep learning models to solve real-world problems, including tasks in image recognition (such as classification and object detection).

**CLO4:** Optimize deep learning models by applying techniques such as hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search) and regularization (dropout, batch normalization).

**CLO5:** Critically evaluate ethical issues related to deep learning, including biases in datasets, fairness in model predictions, and interpretability.
