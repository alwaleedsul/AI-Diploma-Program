## Prerequisites | المتطلبات الأساسية

**Python Version**: Python 3.8+ required (3.10 or 3.11 recommended)

**Knowledge**: Students should have:
- Completion of Courses 01-06 (Semester 1)
- Strong understanding of machine learning
- Familiarity with neural networks basics

**Hardware**: 
- **GPU strongly recommended** for training deep learning models (10-100x faster)
- **Use Google Colab for free GPU access!** (See `DOCS/COLAB_SETUP.md`)
- CPU works but training will be very slow

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) | مخرجات التعلم

**The detailed objectives of the training program are: For the trainee to be able to:**

**CLO1:** Explain basic concepts of deep learning, including the structure and performance of neural networks, backpropagation algorithm, and optimization techniques.

**CLO2:** Develop and implement deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers.

**CLO3:** Build and deploy deep learning models to solve real-world problems, including tasks in image recognition (such as classification and object detection).

**CLO4:** Optimize deep learning models by applying techniques such as hyperparameter tuning (grid search, random search) and regularization (dropout, batch normalization).

**CLO5:** Critically evaluate ethical issues related to deep learning, including biases in datasets, fairness in model predictions, and interpretability.
