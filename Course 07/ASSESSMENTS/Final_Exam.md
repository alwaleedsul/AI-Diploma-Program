D) Only summarization

---

## Part 2: Short Answer Questions (30 points)

### Question 7 (10 points)
**CLO1, CLO2:** Explain the complete text preprocessing pipeline for NLP. Include tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal. Why is each step important?

---

### Question 8 (10 points)
**CLO4:** Explain the attention mechanism in Transformers. How does it help with NLP tasks?

---

### Question 9 (10 points)
**CLO7:** Discuss ethical challenges in NLP. Provide examples of bias in NLP systems and how to mitigate them.

---

## Part 3: Practical/Coding Questions (25 points)

### Question 10 (15 points)
**CLO2, CLO3:** Implement a complete sentiment analysis pipeline:
1. Preprocess text (tokenize, remove stop words, lemmatize)
2. Vectorize using TF-IDF
3. Train a classifier (Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)
4. Evaluate on test data
5. Predict sentiment for new text

Use sample data: ["I love this product!", "Terrible quality", "It's okay"]

---

### Question 11 (10 points)
**CLO5, CLO8:** Write code to load a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face and fine-tune it for sentiment analysis.

---

## Part 4: Case Study / Real-World Application (15 points)

### Question 12 (15 points)
**CLO6, CLO10:** Design an end-to-end NLP system for a customer service chatbot that:
1. Processes customer queries in multiple languages
2. Classifies intent (question, complaint, request)
3. Generates appropriate responses
4. Handles ethical considerations (bias, privacy)

Include:
- Complete pipeline design
- Technology choices
- Evaluation strategy
- Ethical safeguards
