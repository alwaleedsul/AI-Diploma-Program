## 🎯 Core Principles for Mastery

### 1. **Mastery-Based Learning**
Students must demonstrate mastery before moving forward, not just pass with 60%.

### 2. **Multiple Learning Modalities**
Different students learn differently - provide visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and reading/writing approaches.

### 3. **Progressive Difficulty**
Start simple, build complexity gradually, ensure foundation is solid before advancing.

### 4. **Real-World Application**
Connect every concept to practical, real-world applications students can relate to.

### 5. **Continuous Feedback**
Provide immediate, actionable feedback at every step.
