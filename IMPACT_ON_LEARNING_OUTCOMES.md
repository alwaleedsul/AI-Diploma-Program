## 📊 Impact Analysis by Item

### 1. Fix Empty Code Cells ✅ NO IMPACT

**What it is:**
- Removing empty code cells from notebooks
- Just formatting/cleanup

**Impact on Learning Outcomes:**
- ❌ **NO impact** - Empty cells don't teach anything
- ✅ **Positive side effect** - Cleaner notebooks are easier to read
- ✅ **No curriculum changes** - All content stays the same
- ✅ **No CLO changes** - Learning objectives unchanged

**Example:**
- Before: Notebook has empty cell → students see blank cell
- After: Notebook has no empty cells → students see only content
- **Learning outcome:** Same - students learn the same concepts

---

### 2. Add More Examples to Course 05 ✅ POSITIVE IMPACT

**What it is:**
- Adding 5-10 more example notebooks to Course 05
- More examples covering the same topics

**Impact on Learning Outcomes:**
- ✅ **POSITIVE impact** - More examples = better learning
- ✅ **Better coverage** - Students see more use cases
- ✅ **Same CLOs** - Still covering the same learning objectives
- ✅ **No curriculum changes** - Just more examples of the same topics

**Example:**
- Current: Course 05 has 41 notebooks covering all CLOs
- After: Course 05 has 46-51 notebooks covering the same CLOs
- **Learning outcome:** IMPROVED - students learn better with more examples

**CLOs Still Covered:**
- CLO1: Analyze and visualize data ✅ (more examples)
- CLO2: Scale data processing ✅ (more examples)
- CLO3: Clean and prepare data ✅ (more examples)
- CLO4: Build ML models ✅ (more examples)
- CLO5: Complete data science project ✅ (same)

### 3. Documentation Improvements ✅ POSITIVE IMPACT

**What it is:**
- Consolidating redundant documentation files
- Adding unit-level READMEs where missing
- Better organization

**Impact on Learning Outcomes:**
- ✅ **POSITIVE impact** - Better navigation = easier learning
- ✅ **No content changes** - Same curriculum, better organized
- ✅ **No CLO changes** - Learning objectives unchanged
- ✅ **Improved experience** - Students find content easier

**Example:**
- Before: Students confused by multiple QUICK_REFERENCE files
- After: One clear QUICK_REFERENCE file, better organized
- **Learning outcome:** IMPROVED - students navigate better, learn faster

**What Changes:**
- File organization ✅
- Navigation clarity ✅
- Documentation structure ✅

**What Doesn't Change:**
- Curriculum content ❌
- Learning objectives ❌
- Course materials ❌
- CLOs ❌

### 4. File Organization ✅ NO IMPACT

**What it is:**
- Organizing root-level files better
- Removing redundant files
- Improving navigation

**Impact on Learning Outcomes:**
- ❌ **NO impact** - Just file organization
- ✅ **Positive side effect** - Cleaner repository
- ✅ **No content changes** - All course materials stay the same
- ✅ **No curriculum changes** - Same learning path

**Example:**
- Before: 24 root-level files, some redundant
- After: 20 root-level files, well-organized
- **Learning outcome:** Same - students access the same content
